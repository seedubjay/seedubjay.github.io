It has taken hundreds of thousands of lifetimes to create what we know as the internet. Entire careers, entire research teams and entire companies have committed themselves to refining the internet over the course of decades. So how can anyone new to the field possibly get up to speed? In truth, it is a Sisyphean task. Instead, a new computer scientist must place their faith in the code of millions of other people, many of whom may be dead by now, and carve out their own little area where they can have deep knowledge and understanding.


We place extraordinary faith in the engineers who have created the Internet by entrusting it with our personal information, our money, and our businesses. Of course, we place faith in things all the time, but when you drive over a bridge or get injected with a vaccine, you can reassure yourself by imagining all the simulations the engineers must have done and all the trials the doctors must have performed. There is no such reassurance for most people when it comes to the Internet.
