title: Computers Aren't So Magical
subtitle: four answers to the question "what do you do?"

_So... What do you actually do in computer science?_

I currently study undergraduate computer science at the University of Cambridge, and this is by far one of the hardest questions I get asked on a regular basis. Most compscis ("computer scientists") hear this question from their friends and family often, and the reactions are very mixed.

There are certainly some who find this question frustrating, and I don't blame them. Spending your entire career on a topic and then being asked to summarise it in a punchy one-liner can be somewhat deflating. 

There are also some who take great glee in adding to the mystique around computer science (often using a revolting number of references to 'wizardry' and 'magic' along the way).

And there are some who simply have a light joke at their friends' expense for not knowing any keyboard shortcuts, or not knowing how to log into their WiFi correctly.

I don't find any of these options very _useful_ though. 

It is true that computer science is a quite poorly understood field. When people ask me what I do in my degree and I ask them back _"Well, what do you think I do?"_, the answer is something along the lines of  _"I honestly haven't got the faintest idea"_ probably over three-quarters of the time.

Frankly, it verges on bizarre that _so few people_ have any idea why or how the computers which run our government, communication, entertainment, hospitals, military, businesses and schools work.

There are arguments for if the 'greater public' is to blame for this, or governments, or schools perhaps. However, I find something to be inarguable... **If no-one apart from compscis know how computers work anymore, then how can anyone apart from compscis be to blame?** 

If computer science is truly changing the world (and I happen to think it is), it is up to their creators to explain to the world why it is important and worthy of people's time. 

My hope for this website/blog/diary (?) is that it can add to this conversation in a small way. I love computer science and I want everyone else to love it just as much as me.

But, more importantly, I want to be frank and be straightforward. My hope is that absolutely anyone who is curious can engage with what's happening in computer science in a meaningful way here.

And so, coming full circle, what do I actually do in computer science? Here are a few of the explanations I usually give.

### The short one

Computer scientists don't really code that much. But they _do_ do pretty much everything else from designing the programming language, to designing the hardware for the code, to researching new fancy things which could be coded in the future (like AI, blockchain, etc). They make computers faster, more power efficient, more secure, safer, and easier to use.

### The hypothetical one

Imagine opening your phone, opening Facebook, then 'liking' a video.

Here's my question: What is the power button doing in your phone? How does your phone know where all the apps should be on the screen? How does it know you just tapped on the Facebook app? How can your phone reach across the world to get an video, then show it to you? How can you press a button, then that button press is announced to the whole world?

Computer scientists think about all of these questions. They think about how to turn a computer off and on to save energy. They think about how to store huge amounts of data in one place. They think about how to create touch-screens and other new ways to interact with the computer. They think about how to render images like app icons on a screen. They think about how to make sure devices can all use WiFi and not interrupt each other. They think about how your phone knows "where" to find information about Facebook in the internet. They think about what it means to 'log in' and how to protect every user's data. They think about how to design a service which billions of people all use at once. They think about how to represent a video as 1s and 0s and send them down a copper pipe. They think about how to broadcast to the whole world when something tiny happens like 'liking' a video. 

Computers are extremely complicated machines that are doing extremely diverse things around the world. Computer scientists make sure these computers are as good as they can be, and are constantly looking for new ways to make them more useful.

### The history-buff one

There used to be lots of basic things that people found really hard to do - doing long series of calculations; storing huge amounts of information in one place; sending pulses of electricity down a copper wire; turning on a certain pixel on a TV screen. People realised that you could do lots of these simple things with electricity and wires, so they put all of these new gadgets into a box together and called it a computer. Once they did that, they realised they could start combining these gadgets in more and more interesting and complex ways.

Computer scientists have kept doing that ever since. Some focus on making all the basic gadgets inside work as well as possible. Some are combining all the gadgets in new and interesting ways. Some are thinking up entirely new gadgets that might be useful in the future. Everyone is working towards the goal of making the computers as powerful as possible.

### The analogy one

Software engineers are a bit like doctors. They are both on the front-lines of their field. Doctors are appyling their knowledge to heal people. Software engineers are making apps and tools to help people. But behind the scenes to doctors is a whole world of research and infrastructure. There are people making new medical discoveries in labs. There are people trying to improve the manufacturing process for drugs to make them cheaper or more effective. There are people running the logistics of hospitals to make sure there are enough doctors in every ward, and enough equipment for them. 

Behind software engineers, there is a whole world of computer science. There are people designing new chips and other hardware that can run faster than before. There are people designing systems which let you store data in the cloud and access it anywhere around the world. There are people creating the programming languages that software engineers use to do their job and create new apps. There are people designing systems to encrypt data to so that you can be sure that your data stays private.
