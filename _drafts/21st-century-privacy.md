subtitle: Does privacy matter in the modern world?
---

Privacy is an odd concept.

Unlike a right to free speech or a right to equality, it has no clear definition in legislation or in society. However, we all seem to 'know' what it means, one way or another. I call this _the ickiness scale_.

Security cameras in the street? _A bit icky._

Security cameras with facial recognition? _Ickier._

A database for government to track your location at any time based on those cameras? _Ickiest by far._

Privacy has taken on a whole new meaning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. More and more of our lives are shifting online, and the current pandemic has only accelerated this trend.

However, the dialogue around privacy seems to be lagging behind. When we discuss privacy, we think about it in physical terms. We imagine Kate the police officer looking at our 'file' at the police station. We imagine Dave the advertiser scanning over a list of our previous purchases.

We instinctively use these structures to frame our thoughts and turn vague, principled arguments into tangible questions about human relationships -- _"Am I comfortable with Kate or Dave knowing this thing about me?"_.

However, the world is rapidly becoming far more inhumane, and the way we approach these questions must change with it.

### A surge in data

It's difficult to understate the profound value of data in the modern world. Historian Yuval Noah Harari sums this up nicely:

> "At present, people are happy to give away their most valuable asset—their personal data—in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. It’s a bit like African and Native American tribes who unwittingly sold entire countries to European imperialists in exchange for colorful beads and cheap trinkets." -- Yuval Noah Harari, 21 Lessons for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century

Privacy no longer just refers to your phone number or a past purchase on Amazon. It refers to every website you visit and every link you click. Every search query, every photo, and every mouse movement. Every 4G tower you connect to, every GPS signal you emit, and every text you send. And while it's easy to dismiss these things as just banal facts, they can be used to predict deeply personal information -- your politics, your medical issues, your religious beliefs, your wealth and more.

### A decline in transparency

As more of our world shifts online, it becomes easier by the day for companies' and governments' creepiness to be hidden behind jargon and code.

For example, consider the security camera example from above.

Curiously, all three levels of surveillance _look completely identical_. After all, it's just a camera on a pole. However, the software driving these systems could turn from harmless to terrifying in a single software update and no-one would ever know, unless the owners disclosed the change.

Privacy was not always this way. If papparazzi stuck a camera in your face, you could be fairly certain how your information was being collected and _for what purpose_. It was clear where your data was going (i.e. to the newspapers), and it was clear how you could avoid this situation in the future.

However, the rules have changed. The ease with which companies and governments can track and analyse the oblivious masses is frightening. They do not need to disclose how they collect it, how they store it, or how they analyse it or profit from it. And even when they act responsibly with their data, there is a constant risk of that data being stolen, and someone else doing something even worse. This has happened many times already, and it certain to happen again frequently.

These new considerations when thinking about privacy - the power of fine-grained data, the lack of transparency, the risks of outside attack - make it more important than ever to understand how you are being tracked every day.
